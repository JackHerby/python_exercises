"""
Write a simple guessing game.
The computer must randomly select a number in the range of 1 to 100.
Then:

Ask the question: "Guess the number: " and get the number from the keyboard.
Check if the input is indeed a number and display the message
"It's not a number!" if there is an error, then return to step 1.
If the number entered by the user is smaller than the randomly selected one,
display the message "Too small!", then return to step 1.
If the number entered by the user is greater than the randomly selected one,
display the message "Too big!", then return to step 1.
If the number entered by the user is equal to the randomly selected one,
display the message "You win!", then end the program.
Example:
Guess the number: hello
It's not a number!
Guess the number: 50
Too small!
Guess the number: 75
Too big!
Guess the number: 63
You win!
