# Assignment

Implement a reversed number guessing game in a web application using the Flask framework.
The user is provided with a form containing three buttons: **Too small**, **Too big**, and **You win**.

Store the current values of the `min` and `max` variables in hidden form fields (input fields of type `hidden`).

**Note:** This is not a secure solution, as the user can manually modify the HTML, for example, using Firebug.
However, for this scenario, it is completely sufficient.
At worst, they will spoil the fun for themselves.
